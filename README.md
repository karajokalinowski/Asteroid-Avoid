# Asteroid Avoid

Game created by Kara Jo Kalinowski for [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/) using [Game Maker](https://gamemaker.io/en). Game was created to be like a flappy bird clone. It uses diagonal movement and a jetpack where the goal is to dodge asteroids. It tracks your high score also.
